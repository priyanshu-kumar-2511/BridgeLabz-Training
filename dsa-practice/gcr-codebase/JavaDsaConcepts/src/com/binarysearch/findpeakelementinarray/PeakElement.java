/*Binary Search Problem 2: Find the Peak Element in an Array
Problem:
A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Write a program that performs Binary Search to find a peak element in an array. If there are multiple peak elements, return any one of them.
Approach:
Initialize left as 0 and right as n - 1.
Perform a binary search:
Find the middle element mid = (left + right) / 2.
If arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1] and arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1], arr[mid] is a peak element.
If arr[mid] < arr[mid - 1], then search the left half, updating right = mid - 1.
If arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1], then search the right half, updating left = mid + 1.
Continue until a peak element is found.
