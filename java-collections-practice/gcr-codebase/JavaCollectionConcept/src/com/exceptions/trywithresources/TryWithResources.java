/*5. try-with-resources (Auto-closing Resources)
💡 Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that reads the first line of a file named "info.txt" using BufferedReader.
Use try-with-resources to ensure the file is automatically closed after reading.
Handle any IOException that may occur.
Expected Behavior:
If the file exists, print its first line.
If the file does not exist, catch IOException and print "Error reading file".
