// There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
// Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
// Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
// You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

// Array : Problem no. 33
